      "description": "The Department of Chemical Engineering was established in 2018 with the intake of the first undergraduate batch. Since then the department has grown to the first batch graduating in 2021. In 2019 the first two faculty joined the department as a Visiting Professor and Assistant Professor and the department started functioning. An amalgam blend of experience and energy the department has grown from humble beginnings to soar to new heights."
